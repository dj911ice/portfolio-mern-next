                    <p>
                        The site is organized into experience, projects, courses, credentials, blog, and links. To go
                        back home then click, Home within the navigation. Experience is a listing of professional and
                        volunteer experiences where as projects is where featured projects are shown via a slideshow.
                        For courses & credentials, these are fetched from an Express server and are displayed
                        appropriately to demonstrate different ways of displaying data. The blog page is reduced set of
                        Medium articles authored by me and it is set to display 3 articles. Lastly, the links are a list
                        (collection) of links where I give credit to the creators of the technologies & tools that allow
                        not only myself but everyone else to create for the mobile, web, and beyond.
